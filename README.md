# asherellis.net

This repository contains the source for [asherellis.net](https://asherellis.net), Asher Ellis's personal website. The content is a small collection of static HTML and CSS files that can be viewed locally by opening `index.html` in a web browser.

## Deployment

The site is hosted through **GitHub Pages**. The `CNAME` file specifies the custom domain and a `.nojekyll` file tells GitHub to serve the files as-is without Jekyll processing. Publishing is as simple as pushing updates to the `main` branch.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. By submitting a contribution you agree to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE). Please keep contributions simple and focused on improving the site.
