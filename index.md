I grew up in San Diego and am now studying at [Yale](http://www.yale.edu){:target="blank"}. I am interested in startups, defense, and data.

Currently, I work at [500 Global](https://500.co){:target="blank"}, tracking and analyzing our portfolio metrics.

Some of my writing is in the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-death-of-the-student-athlete-11626215803){:target="blank"} and [Merion West](https://merionwest.com/2021/02/24/review-the-klondike-bake-oven-deaths/){:target="blank"}.
