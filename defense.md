I aspire to serve my country as an Air Force officer.

**U.S. Air Force (ROTC Cadet)**, August 2020-present.

I've launched several initiatives within our detachment, including:
 • Det 009 Knowledge Transfer Hub: enabling cadets to learn from trainings they did not attend
 • Ruck and Fin: a supplemental, low-stakes fitness group
 • Det 009 Internship Sharing: helping cadets access defense-aligned internship opportunities

I have also had the opportunity to converse with four-star generals, take private pilot lessons, and challenge myself in ways I've never experienced.

**Joint Service Cadet Network (Founder)**, October 2021-present.

I built an online community of over 100 aspiring military officers nationwide. My goals is to foster collaboration on projects, facilitate discourse on foreign affairs and defense technology, and connect cadets with similar niche interests.

**Defense Entrepreneurs Forum (Operations)**, August 2021-present.

I am expanding DEF's internship program to create student roles in operations, development, and communications. I am helping drive student involvement in annual conferences.
