I aspire to serve my country as an Air Force officer.

**U.S. Air Force (ROTC Cadet)**, August 2020-present.

- I've launched several initiatives within our detachment, including:
 - Ruck and Fin: a supplemental, low-stakes fitness group
 - Det 009 Knowledge Transfer Hub: enabling cadets to learn from trainings they did not attend
 - A group for sharing defense-aligned internships and project opportunities

I have also had the opportunity to converse with four-star generals, take private pilot lessons, and challenge myself in ways I've never experienced.

**Joint Service Cadet Network (Founder)**, October 2021-present.

- I built an online community of over 100 aspiring military officers from ROTC programs and service academies nationwide. Our goals are to share work opportunities, discuss current events in foreign affairs and defense technology, and connect with other cadets with similar interests.

**Defense Entrepreneurs Forum (Operations)**, August 2021-present.

- As a volunteer, I am helping expand the organization's internship program to create student roles in operations, development, and communications. I am also driving student involvement in annual conferences and conducting outreach to strengthen university partnerships.
