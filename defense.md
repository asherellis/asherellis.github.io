I aspire to serve my country as an Air Force officer.

**U.S. Air Force (ROTC Cadet)**, August 2020-present.
As a cadet, I practice leadership skills to prepare to commission as a second lieutenant upon graduation. I launched several initiatives within our detachment, including:
- An group for sharing defense-aligned internships and project opportunities
- Ruck and Fin: a fitness group for supplemental training
- A knowledge transfer hub to allow cadets who couldn't attend trainings to connect with and learn from those who did

I also have had the opportunity to take private pilot lessons, converse with four-star generals, and challenge myself in ways I've never experienced.

**Joint Service Cadet Network (Founder)**, October 2021-present.
I built an online community of over 100 aspiring military officers from ROTC programs and service academies nationwide. Our goals are to share work opportunities, discuss current events in foreign affairs and defense technology, and connect with other cadets with similar interests.

**Defense Entrepreneurs Forum (Operations)**, August 2021-present.
As a volunteer, I am helping expand the organization's internship program to create student roles in operations, development, and communications. I am also driving student involvement in annual conferences and conducting outreach to strengthen university partnerships.
