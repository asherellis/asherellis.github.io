I've had the privilege of working and learning at several venture capital firms.

**500 Global (Intern, Data Team)**, September 2021 to present.

I developed an original composite scoring system to evaluate over 2500 portfolio companies, now used across the entire legal and strategy teams. I am responsible for ensuring our investment data is accurate and accessible.

**shl.vc (Scout)**, July 2021 to present.

I source early-stage technology startups for Sahil Lavingia's rolling fund. I spend most of my time reviewing pitch decks, conducting preliminary due-diligence, and chatting with founders. We invest in elegant, easy-to-use software solutions to complex or boring problems.

**Glasswing Ventures (Venture Fellow)**, October 2021 to present.

I'm participating in a year-long educational program by an frontier tech/AI-focused VC firm. I evaluate and diligence potential deals, conduct market analysis, examine product defensibility, and do other mini-projects with undergrad/MBA students around the country.
