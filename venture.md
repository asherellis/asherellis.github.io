I've had the privilege of working and learning at several venture capital firms.

**500 Global (Intern, Data Team)**, September 2021 to present.

I developed an original composite scoring system to evaluate over 2500 portfolio companies, which is now used across the entire legal and strategy teams. I am also responsible for ensuring our investment data is accurate and accessible.

**shl.vc (Scout)**, July 2021 to present.

I source early-stage technology startups for Sahil Lavingia's rolling fund. I spend most of my time reviewing pitch decks and conducting preliminary due-diligence, and chatting with founders. We invest in B2B SaaS, future of work, consumer social, and developer tools.

**Glasswing Ventures (Fellow)**, October 2021 to present.

I evaluate and diligence potential deals, market and competitive landscapes, defensibility of solutions, team qualifications, and more. We're focused on AI and frontier tech.
