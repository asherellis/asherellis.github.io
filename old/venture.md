I've had the privilege of working and learning at several venture capital firms.

**500 Global (Intern, Data Team)**, September 2021 to present.

I developed an original composite scoring method to evaluate our portfolio companies. Overall, I am responsible for ensuring our investment data is accurate and accessible.

**shl.vc (Scout)**, July 2021 to present.

I source early-stage technology startups for Sahil Lavingia's rolling fund. We invest in elegant, easy-to-use solutions to complex or boring problems. I spend most of my time reviewing pitch decks, conducting due-diligence, and chatting with founders.

**Glasswing Ventures (Venture Fellow)**, October 2021 to present.

I am participating in a year-long educational program by an frontier tech/AI-focused VC firm. I evaluate potential deals, analyze product defensibility, and do small research projects with undergrad/MBA students around the country.
